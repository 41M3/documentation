# Campaign Builder

The Mautic campaign builder gives you a blank canvas upon which to build your campaign workflow. The overall interface is clean and simple with easy to use actions and decisions. These actions and decisions can be either clicked or dragged and dropped onto the campaign builder canvas.

### Actions

Campaign actions are those items which are initiated by you. These are items which you will control and which affect your leads involved in the campaign. Examples of these actions are adjusting a lead's point totals, moving a lead to a different campaign, modifying the lists a particular lead is a part of, and lastly but perhaps most importantly sending of an email.

When you create a campaign you will select one of these actions to begin the workflow. In most cases this initial step will be an email sent to your lead lists.

You will notice that when you add an email to a campaign you will be able to select a potential *delay* for when the email is delivered.

After you have added an action you will more than likely place a decision on the campaign.

### Decisions

Decisions are actions which are initiated by the lead. These decisions can be either directly initiated or implied based on non-action. Samples of these decisions are downloading an asset, opening an email, submitting a form, or visiting a landing page.

Decisions are taken in response to an action and as such a decision has two outcomes.

These two options are demonstrated by the green and red decision points on the decision.  Each path can then be handled by your campaign. This process is typically referred to as a **decision tree**.

#### Example

To provide a simple example of a decision tree consider an email where the decision is to open an email. There are two outcomes, if the lead chooses to open the email then the green decision point leads to the next action to be taken in the campaign workflow. If, however, the lead does not open the email then you may desire a different action to be taken (e.g. a delay of 30 days then a second email sent).
