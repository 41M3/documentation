# Mautic Documentation

### Introduction
This book serves as the [documentation for Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/docs/index.html), the open source marketing automation system. Just as the code is open source and available for everyone, so is the documentation. Everyone is welcome to help make this information better and improve as needed.
