# Leads

Leads are the central factor of a marketing automation platform. These are all the individuals who have visited your websites or interacted with you in some way.

### Lead Types

There are two many types of leads. The first type of lead is the anonymous lead. These are visitors to your site who have not yet been identified by a form or other interaction. These leads are tracked by Mautic but typically remain hidden so as not to clutter your lead list.

The second type of lead is a standard lead. These are leads which have provided additional information via a form or some other source. As a result, these leads typically have a name, email, and other identifying fields.

#### Anonymous Leads

As mentioned anonymous leads are those leads which have not yet completed a form or other identifying feature and thus you do not have completed information to accompany the lead. You can view these leads by entering the following in the lead search box.

##### Search Text

```
is:anonymous
```

The resulting list will be those IP addresses which have not yet provided additional details.


#### Standard Leads

The standard lead is the preferred lead within Mautic. These are leads which may have started as an anonymous lead but have at some point provided additional information such as name, email address, social network handle, or other identifying characteristics. These leads are ones which can then be nurtured through the Mautic marketing automation platform.

The following information in the Manage Leads section will provide more information about what can be managed with these standard leads.
