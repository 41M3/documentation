# Manage Leads

The manage leads page allows you to view the many leads contained within your system and see more information on many of them. Below is an overview of what can be done through the Mautic marketing automation platform.

### Lead Lists

The lead list is the default tabular view of all the leads in the system. You can manipulate this view through the search box as well as reorder using the table headings.

The searchbox allows many different search types and follows the same search process and variables as found in all other search layouts. You can learn more about the powerful search options available on the search documentation page.

### Quick Add Leads

If you have leads you would like to manually add to Mautic and they are not in the system as part of the normal workflow you can use the Quick Add Lead button to add them to the system.

You can of course also add them through the New Lead form and add much more detail but for quick entry you can use the Quick Add modal.

### Lead Views
You can quickly toggle between viewing your leads in tabular (list) view and card (grid) view. Clicking the appropriate button on the top right will allow you to switch between the two views.

Hint: If you prefer using keyboard shortcuts you can enter "t" on your keyboard to dynamically switch to table view and "c" to switch to the card view.
