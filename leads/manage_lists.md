# Manage Lists

Lists provide ways to easily organize your leads. These lists can be configured from a variety of fields.

When viewing all lead lists you will notice the column on the right which shows the number of leads matching that particular list.

### Smart Lists

Once you have created your list any applicable lead will be automatically added. This is the essence of smart lists.

### Manual Addition
In addition to smart lists you can also manually add any lead to a list by selecting the radio toggle on the lead detail view.
