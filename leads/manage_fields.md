# Manage Fields

The manage fields page will let you view all existing lead fields as well as any custom lead fields you've created.

You will notice the group column which will show you where the specific field will be shown on the lead profile. Also, the last column which demonstrates which fields are protected (shown with a lock). These fields are unable to be removed as they are used by the core installation. The second icon demonstrates those fields which can be used in search results.

### Published Fields

The checkmark which shows before each label title is a clickable toggle which will publish and unpublish the field.

### New Field

You can create additional custom fields and define the data type you want that field to hold. In addition to the data type you will also select the group for that particular field. This will define where the field displays on the lead edit and detail view.
