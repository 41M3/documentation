# Manage Forms

The new form view lets you create a form and attach any fields you want to collect from your users. After you've created the fields you can then define what actions you want to perform after the user submits the information.

### Form Overview

The form overview provides a quick overview of the submissions received over a time period to easily analyze how successful a particular form is. The bottom of the form overview outlines the fields and actions included as part of a particular form.

### Form Fields

A form can contain as many fields as needed. These fields can be laid out dynamically by the system or handled via HTML if you want more control.

### Form Actions

Form actions are items to be handled on the submission of the form. You can define multiple actions to be performed on each submission.

### Form Injection

There are three ways you can use the form. You can copy the entire output or you can have the form injected dynamically using the provided javascript. These are two options for directly including the form on a page, you can alternatively embed the form directly in a Mautic landing page if you choose.

### Form results

When on the form overview page you can click the Results button located in the top right to open a tabular view of all form submissions. These results can be easily filtered and sorted by each column heading.

### Form Preview

The form preview provides a popup overview of what the form will look like. Remember that form styling is controlled by the surrounding page or website content and thus will display differently in final layout then in the preview.
