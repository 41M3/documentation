### Translations and Variants

### New/Edit Pages

The page form allows you to create new pages and offers a number of fields for your convenience. You will notice most of them in the following screenshot.  In particular you will notice the Page Builder button on the top toolbar. This is where you will launch the page builder to easily create your page layouts.
