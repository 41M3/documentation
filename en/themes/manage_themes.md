# Manage themes

## Assigning a default theme

It is possible to assign a default theme to a Mautic instance by editing the global configuration.  To access the global configuration you must be logged in with sufficient access.  Click on the cog icon beside the logged in user, and select 'Configuration'.

From the configuration screen, the available themes will be listed in a dropdown box, which can be selected.  On saving, this setting will apply for all resources which do not have a theme explicitly specified.

To assign a theme to a specific resource - such as a landing page - select the theme from the dropdown, and save the resource.
