# Manage Assets
## Categories
Assets can be organised in categories, which allows you to easily locate resources.  To create a new category, browse to the Assets section and click on 'Manage Categories'.

To create a new category, click on 'New' which can be found in the top right of the screen.

Name the category something that reflects the 'filing system' you are intending to use, and provide a short description of the category.

The alias field will be automatically populated from the title field unless you manually enter it - this is used to create the URL path so it should ideally contain hyphens instead of spaces.

You can choose to color-code your categories by either typing in a hex code, or using the color picker to select the color for the category.

To make a category published, yes should be highlighted - if you don't want it to be published click on 'No' to set the category as unpublished.

To save the changes and continue editing, press 'Apply'.  To save the changes and go back to the categories screen, press 'Save & Close'.  To cancel your changes and return to the categories screen, press 'Cancel'
